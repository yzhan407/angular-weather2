# AngularWeather2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

Using [open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/), [ng2-charts](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-charts), 
[weather icon](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/), [material design](https://material.angular.io/),
[prettier](https://prettier.io/)

For open weather map, used one call API, but there are only 48hours weather in this API
<br>
So hourly API is needed for clicking different days in order to get the chart update
<br>
Might change it to the hourly api initially in the future, maybe not(probably not)
<br>
There are many improvements needed, e.g. there could be a dropdown or auto complete using geocode api<br>
so when the user type something wrong we can still show the right location in the dropdown
